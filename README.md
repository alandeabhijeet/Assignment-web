# Animated Progress Bar with Undo/Redo Functionality

This is a React-based project that demonstrates an animated progress bar with undo/redo functionality. The progress bar is restricted between 0 and 150, and the application includes a smooth loading animation on startup.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Buttons to increment or decrement the value within the range of 0 to 150.
- **Undo/Redo**: Buttons to undo or redo the last action, with a history tracking mechanism.
- **Animated Progress Bar**: The progress bar visually reflects the current value as a percentage of the maximum limit (150).
- **Loading Animation**: A brief loading screen is displayed for 4.5 seconds when the app first loads.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Assignment-web-main
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

- **Increment/Decrement**: Use the "Add" and "Subtract" buttons to change the number displayed.
- **Undo/Redo**: Use the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to navigate through the history of changes.
- **Progress Bar**: The progress bar dynamically updates based on the current number, displaying the progress relative to the maximum value of 150.
